Humanoid dexterous hands have significant potential in pros-thetics, service robotics, and high-performance manipulation However, existing designs often struggle to balance the chal-lenging requirements of lightweight design, high biomimicry, personalized customization, and low cost. To address these challenges, we present the CYJ hand (Customize-Your-Joy Hand), an innovative 22-DOF humanoid dexterous hand. Fea-turing a highly biomimetic structure, the CYJ system weighs only 750 grams（forearm included）. Its modular design supports user-oriented customization while simplifying assembly, maintenance, and functional expansion. Inspired by Da Vinci’s mechanics, the CYJ hand integrates a novel, controllable ten-don coupling mechanism that allows for reconfigurable tendon layout and actuation system to meet diverse needs. Constructed with 3D printing and affordable commercial materials, the hardware cost for the CYJ hand structure (excluding actuators) is under $60.  Experimental results demonstrate the CYJ hand’s 100% success rate in both the Kapandji Test and GRASP taxonomy, validating its exceptional dexterity and biomimetic performance With its comprehensive advantages and innovations， the CYJ hand provides a versatile platform for future application and research in personalized prosthetics and dexterous robotic manipulation, bridging the gap between high dexterity and accessibility in humanoid robotics.
